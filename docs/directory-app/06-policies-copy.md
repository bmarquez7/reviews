# Community Policies and Business Guidelines

This directory is here to share practical, firsthand experiences in a respectful way. Ratings and comments should be professional, specific, and based on what happened to you personally. We remove content that is hateful, harassing, private, or not firsthand.

You may post ratings and comments about your own firsthand experiences with a business location.
You may also post factual updates that help others, like accessibility notes or whether pricing is posted clearly.
Prohibited: hate speech or discrimination, harassment, threats, doxxing, personal attacks, hearsay, accusations of crimes without credible public documentation, spam or advertising.
